This difference can be made even worse if we were to change the units of one of our features, e.g. changing a measurement in kg to grams would change that coefficient by 1000 which has no effect on the fit of our linear regression model (predictions and other coefficients would be unchanged) but would have a meaningful impact on the estimates given by a Ridge or Lasso regression model, since that coefficient would now dominate the penalty term.\n",
